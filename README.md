# Lyxbux.Helper
A lightweight ⚙️ .NET library 📦 that provides a unified 🔗, flexible 🧩 solution for exception handling 🚨, logging 📝, and message presentation 💬.

## ⚠️ Note
- Currently, only the base class for exception handling 🚨 is supported.
- I'm not planning to add more features ➕ right now, as there's no immediate need.
- Future updates will be made based on user feedback 💬 and real use cases.
